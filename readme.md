# Sasquatch

This plugin convert HTML pasted from MS Word 2011 (for OS X) into the Visual field of tinyMCE in Wordpress into the HTML syntax recognized by [bigfoot.js][0175-0001]. Even if you don't use Bigfoot, the markup will probably be nicer.

# Install instructions

Download or clone this repository. Upload the folder into wp-content/plugins and activate the plugin.

# Usage

The plugin automatically recognizes the HTML-markup from Word and converts it on update\publish.

# TODO

-   The plugin doesn't support line or paragraph breaks in footnotes (yet).
-   It would be nice if it also generated a unique id for each footnote (in case you have several posts on one page).
-   Some options to turn it off in the editor if it makes trouble.
-   I haven't tested this on Office for Windows yet.
